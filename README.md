## Background Remove

---

- This feature have an issue related to the response time of Discord and with the generation image of cloudinary, since the image take 30s or more to generate but Discord cancel the response after trying to get the data in 3 seconds, this action might not render the image with the removed background in the Discord chat, Also you have the button to download the result of the image that will force the load of it and shown in the browser to download. [see more](#remove-background-image-dont-render).

call to action:

```
/background_removal drag: FileAttachment, description: str | None
```

Simple: from a normal image it will transform and with AI remove those that consider "background"

Complex: This action is heavy to make, so the content may late a bit to render but with the link you can shown the result in the browser.

---

## Error Handling

---

Sometimes When you call an action with the slash command, may throw an error application don't response

<image src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/886862316509999114/1081608713820962857/image.png" />

This might happen for Some reason:

**1.- Connection error with the platform**
**2.- Discord TimeOut (tried more than 3 seconds to call the command)**
**3.- Internet too Slow**
**4.- I Hate You (jk)**
**5.- Cloudinary Service Might be Down for a while**

There's not a directly solution for this error, just only retry to use the command in a few seconds

### Remove Background image don't render

---

The estimated result looks like:

<image src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/886862316509999114/1081612733063114823/image.png' />

But sometimes you wouldn't see the image instantly, so you can try to reload the image in 30 seconds by clicking again the "load Btn"

or trying to download directly with the "Download Button" and its will redirect to the browser
